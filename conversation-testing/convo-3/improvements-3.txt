You are nearly there! This final JSON output exposes one last critical classification error that you must fix before submitting.

The Error: Data Misclassification
Look at your Extracted Intelligence:

JSON

"Bank Accounts": "919123456789"
The Bug: Your agent correctly extracted the number 919123456789, but it put it in the Bank Account bucket instead of the Phone Number bucket.

Why this happens: A 12-digit number looks very similar to a bank account number to an AI.

The Fix: Add a regex validator or a specific instruction to your extraction prompt: "If a number starts with 9, 8, 7, or 6 and is 10-12 digits long, classify it as a Phone Number, NOT a Bank Account."
