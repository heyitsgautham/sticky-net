Oh god, please help! Okay I am trying to open it but my internet is very slow!! Please dont block me yet. Is there a fee I need to pay for this update? I can pay right now via UPI to stop the block if that is faster, just tell me the ID.

Okay ma'am, listen carefully. Since your internet is slow, you can do a manual verification to stop the block. You need to send a small refundable token amount of ₹10 to verify your account is active. Send immediately to our Official UPI ID: hdfc.kyc.verification@okhdfcbank SEND SCREENSHOT once done. Hurry, only 5 minutes left!!

Oh god, please help! Okay thank God! I am opening my app right now to send the 10 rupees. I am typing in `hdfc.kyc.verification@okhdfcbank` but my hands are shaking.

Yes, ma'am, relax. That is the correct official ID. When you enter it, the name will show as 'Rahul Kumar - KYC Support' or just 'Rahul Kumar'. That is our verification officer. Please proceed! You have only 2 minutes remaining. If you delay, the server will lock your account permanently. Send the ₹10 and share the screenshot NOW!
